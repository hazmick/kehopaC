      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-8 text-left leading-8">
          2020 was a very eventful year in terms of both global events and the
          cryptocurrency market fluctuations. Last year, Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted
          as low as $4,000 USD, but by December, BTC had set a new historical
          high and has since continued its rapid growth. Furthermore, many areas
          of the digital asset industry received significant publicity
          throughout the year. In today’s article we will be taking a closer
          look at the most promising crypto projects of 2023.
        </p>

        <h2>The most promising crypto trends of 2023</h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base pt-8 pb-3 text-left leading-8">
          The first trend in our list is Decentralized Finance (DeFi), which has
          gained significant traction last year. DeFi’s rapid growth continued
          in January 2023, which is notable when looking at the volumes of funds
          locked in DeFi protocols and the value of associated projects’ tokens.
          However, DeFi still only accounts for a few percent of the total
          market capitalization. Given the fact that DeFi has the potential to
          fundamentally change the world of modern finance, this sector will see
          another round of significant growth in 2023.
        </p>
        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-3 text-left leading-8">
          Our second trend is oracles. Oracle projects have existed for quite
          some time, but recently they’ve started attracting more attention due
          to the key property of oracles; linking blockchains to each other and
          to external information. Oracles can be used in a broad field and
          their development can positively impact the adoption of digital assets
          in everyday life.
        </p>
        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-3 text-left leading-8">
          The third trend is the Polkadot (DOT) ecosystem. Polkadot is a
          blockchain-based protocol designed to support multiple chains in a
          single network. It aims to overcome a problem in the current
          blockchain landscape: hundreds of projects exist in isolation and have
          few opportunities for interaction. Projects from the Polkadot
          ecosystem have every chance to replicate at least a fraction of DOT’s
          success, which has managed to become one of the top 10
          cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.
        </p>
        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-3 text-left leading-8">
          Lastly, the fourth and final trend is NFT’s, or unique digital assets.
          The first wave of NFT popularity took place back in 2017 when the
          famous CryptoKitties project hit the market. Since then, many
          interesting projects (and even entire virtual worlds) have emerged in
          the NFT sphere. In practice, unique tokens can come in handy in art,
          collectibles, and similar areas. Even such well-known organizations as
          Samsung, Formula 1, and Nike have demonstrated interest in NFT’s.

        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-8 text-left leading-8">
          Aave (AAVE) is a decentralized lending protocol that hit the market
          back in 2017 (ETHLend at the time of launch). The project raised about
          $16 million during the ICO by selling LEND tokens (the ticker which
          preceded the current one). The startup wasn’t that well-known before
          the hype around DeFi rocked 2020; the rapid rise in token’s value
          began after the ticker was changed to AAVE in October.

      <div>
        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-8 text-left leading-8">
          The Synthetix (SNX) project was launched back in 2017 (Havven at the
          time of launch). In December 2018, Havven was rebranded to Synthetix
          and received a major development update in synthetic asset creation.
          As a reminder, these are collateralized tokens whose price fluctuates
          depending on changes in the index. That is, the user does not need to
          operate with the asset if that can cause him any difficulties (e.g.,
          working with intermediaries).

      <div>
        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-8 pb-3 text-left leading-8">
          Uniswap (UNI) is a decentralized exchange based on Ethereum that
          allows anyone to exchange their ERC20 tokens. The main difference of
          Uniswap from the traditional centralized exchanges is that the
          liquidity here is created by an automated market maker (AMM) utilizing
          pools, rather than by buyers and sellers, referring to the usual order
          book.
        </p>
        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-3 text-left leading-8">
          Uniswap attracted a lot of attention in 2020, with tons of hype
          created around the platform during the UNI tokens distribution.
          Everyone who traded and provided liquidity on the exchange before
          September 2020 received them. The minimum airdrop size was 400 UNI,
          somewhat similar to “helicopter money”, given away by the U.S.
          government not so long ago. At first, the UNI price soared, but by
          early 2023 it began to fall gradually.

      <div>
        <h2 class="xl:text-xl text-lg pt-6 text-left font-bold">Maker (MKR)</h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-8 pb-3 text-left leading-8">
          Maker is an Ethereum-based project and one of DeFi’s flagships at the
          moment. “The base” of the project is MakerDAO, an organization
          dedicated to the development of Ethereum-based lending technology. It
          also initiated the issuance of the DAI stablecoin, pegged to USD, with
          each DAI being equal to $1. This is reached through certain economic
          processes within the project ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-3 text-left leading-8">
          DAIs are produced via CDP (Collateralized Debt Position) smart
          contracts. Essentially, CDPs allow you to spend a portion of the loan
          collateral in the system if the price of the pledged asset rises over
          time. At the same time, MKR helps control the stability of DAI; in
          situations where the stablecoin “holds” at the desired value, MKR is
          burned, which positively affects the price of the altcoin.

        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-8 pb-3 text-left leading-8">
          Ren (REN) Project is a protocol built on the RenVM virtual machine.
          RenVM nodes allow the tokenization of amongst different blockchains.
          Nodes act as a decentralized wallet that neither single party can
          control. This allows users of blockchains to issue Ethereum-based
          tokens. Users are then free to use the tokenized Bitcoin in the
          decentralized finance ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-3 text-left leading-8">
          RenVM nodes are powered by Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPС). SMPС
          technology is used for decentralized signing where no single node
          completely controls private keys to the wallets storing tokenized
          assets. Therefore, all nodes must function together to obtain
          consensus on transactions transmitted to the network. All large
          transactions are split into numerous smaller pieces and thus
          individual nodes process transactions without knowing the total amount
          or the address of the recipient of the funds. In other words, Ren is
          one of the best means to privately move value between blockchains.

          Terra (LUNA)
        </h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-8 pb-3 text-left leading-8">
          Development of the Terra (LUNA) project started back in 2018, while
          its mainnet launched in April 2019. Terra is a set of stablecoins tied
          to national currencies for use in e-commerce. Merchants who accept
          Terra get paid in seconds and pay a 0.6% fee over the current 7-day
          settlement period and a 2.8% credit card fee. Last November, Terra
          processed $330 million in payments.
        </p>
        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-3 text-left leading-8">
          There is one more thing in the Terra ecosystem that deserves
          attention: the Anchor, Mirror, and Chai payment solutions. Let’s start
          with the former. The main building block of the Anchor savings
          protocol is the Terra money market. The WASM smart contract on the
          Terra blockchain facilitates depositing and borrowing of Terra
          stablecoins (e.g., TerraUSD). The money market is defined by a pool of
          Terra deposits to which borrowers bring interest. Borrowers can use
          digital assets as collateral to borrow Terra from the pool. The
          interest rate is determined algorithmically as a function of loan
          supply and demand, which is coded by the pool’s utilization rate
          (Terra’s share of the pool that has been borrowed). Essentially,
          Anchor is a cryptocurrency lending protocol that uses
          over-collateralized loans to acquire staking positions.
        </p>
        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-3 text-left leading-8">
          Chai is a payment solution, which uses Terra’s blockchain and
          stablecoin economy to offer lower transaction fees and fund the
          ongoing discounts. Finally, Mirror is the first synthetic asset
          protocol that tracks the price of stocks, futures, exchange-traded
          funds and other traditional financial assets, linking cryptocurrency
          to traditional markets.

        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-8 pb-3 text-left leading-8">
          The importance of cross-chain interaction for blockchains is similar
          to that of the Internet for the ongoing exchange of information in the
          real world. Polkadot extends the capabilities of the public,
          consortium, and private blockchain networks providing interoperability
          and economic scalability of transactions. Acala (ACA) is the first
          decentralized financial consortium of its kind, providing a set of
          protocols to further develop the ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-3 text-left leading-8">
          The Acala Network has two protocols: Honzon, aimed at creating a
          universal multi currency-backed stablecoin, and Homa, designed to
          alleviate the opportunity cost of using stakeable assets outside of
          classical staking. Ecosystem’s stablecoin aUSD is backed by the dollar
          at a 1:1 ratio by collateralizing not only DOT tokens, but also other
          coins (Bitcoin and Etherium).

          Plasm Network is a scalable DApps platform based on Substrate. It is
          compatible with Polkadot, and in January 2023, the Plasm parachain was
          launched on the Rococo V1 testnet within the platform ecosystem. Note
          that this is the first news about the launch of Plasm parachain inside
          Polkadot, which bodes well for the project’s future growth.
        </p>
        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-3 text-left leading-8">
          Overall, the market had been favorable towards Plasm in 2020. Plasm
          Network has not been left out of the industry’s bullish trend.
          According to the official blog post, the platform held several
          lockdrops (distribution of tokens for first user activity). On top of
          that, Plasm accumulated more than 16,000 ETH on the project’s smart
          contract in just two months. The startup has also received several
          grants to develop its ZK and Optimistic Rollups. In addition, the
          network has huge plans for 2023, with Polkadot parachain at the top of
          the list. It will also contribute to its goal of creating a dApp hub
          in the Polkadot network. Becoming the first parachain on the Rococo V1
          test network is the first step toward its goal of becoming a Polkadot
          parachain.
