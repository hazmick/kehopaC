          Cryptocurrency trading is a very lucrative business and a perfect
          alternative to the holding mentality that continues to cripple the
          cryptocurrency community. Given the high volatility nature of the
          cryptocurrency market, it’s extremely easy to make a living trading
          cryptocurrency. Currently, there are several types of trading, but day
          trading remains the most popular. Properly conducted, day trading is
          hugely profitable. It takes a lot of discipline and experience to
          master. Even professional financial advisors and managers tend to shy
          from it. However, with a well-planned strategy, even a novice can make
          it a lucrative career.

          What is Day Trading?

          Day trading is a kind of trading that involves the practice of
          purchasing and selling security within a single trading day. It’s a
          short-term strategy that traders utilize to earn small profits from
          minute, intraday fluctuations in prices of securities or digital
          currencies. It occurs in any market place but is most common in the
          stock, forex, and cryptocurrency markets. Day traders never hold any
          positions overnight; they enter and exit trading positions within the
          same day. Instead, they buy digital assets and hold them for a short
          period, anywhere between a few minutes to a few hours, before they
          sell them off.

          Traders can be classified into two broad categories. Speculators and
          technical analysts. The speculators keep a watchful eye over the
          cryptocurrency market for news and activities that may indicate that
          particular crypto will lose or gain value. Their main concern is
          outside market influences such as coin hacks, developments, and
          significant partnerships, among others. Analysts, on the other hand,
          are concerned about the internal workings of the cryptocurrency market
          and tend to rely on financial patterns and charts for their insight.
          However, as a day trader, it’s vital that you do not confine yourself
          into any of these two broad categories. You may find that being unique
          and true to yourself extremely beneficial.

          Choose Your Marketplace
        </h2>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-8 text-left leading-8">
          The first step towards your day trading journey is to pick a
          marketplace. Different marketplaces offer different fee structures,
          coin pairings, trade amounts, etc. This is extremely important because
          little profits on large trade volumes can quickly disappear into fees.
          Therefore, it’s imperative that you pay attention to fee structures.
          Once you find a viable marketplace, go ahead and find two to three
          other marketplaces and register accounts on each. Doing so gives you
          flexibility in terms of cryptocurrency fees, liquidity, and
          availability.

      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-8 text-left leading-8">
          Next, you need to develop a solid trading strategy. This step involves
          a lot of research and self-discipline. For starters, you need to
          ensure that you do not risk more than you are willing to lose. This
          can be a tough act to practice, but having a conservative strategy
          ensures that you don’t lose your entire cash on risky bets. Day
          trading is a numbers game, and you are bound to make some losses here
          and there. Therefore, it’s way better to collect small gains and
          remain safe rather than to risk big to score big.

          Stop Loss Limits

      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-8 text-left leading-8">
          Another vital factor in cryptocurrency trading is the stop-loss limit
          or as commonly known, your exit strategy. Most exchanges allow traders
          to set a stop loss that automatically exits a trade at a certain price
          level. For instance, if you purchase a particular cryptocurrency at
          $200, you may set a stop loss at $180 to ensure that you at least
          preserve a large chunk of that investment in case prices take a
          nose-dive.

      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-8 text-left leading-8">
          Limit sell order is another important concept in cryptocurrency
          trading. Unlike the stop-loss order, the limit sell order
          automatically closes a trade one once your digital asset hits a
          specific high price. For instance, if the said digital asset is on an
          upward trend, and you perceive the top market price to be $300, you
          can set a limit sell order of that amount. Once the asset hits that
          price point, the limit sell order will automatically sell your asset.

          The cryptocurrency trading market is currently filled with a large
          number of trading bots and trading algorithms. Some are freely
          available on open-source platforms while others are given at a fee. As
          tempting as it is to utilize the services of these trading bots,
          extreme caution is recommended. Crypto trading bots are only as good
          as their programming. Therefore, any corruption in their code, and you
          can expect them to make mistakes. However, we recommend using the
          Hazmick crypto trading bot as it’s easy to set up and performs
          reliably compared to most of its competitors. Features such as bot
          performance analytics, social trading, portfolio creation and tracking
          make it a robust option for any trader interested in automated
          cryptocurrency day trading.

      <div>
        <p class="tracking-wide text-sm xl:text-base py-8 text-left leading-8">
          Scalping is a standout strategy in day trading that’s well-recognized
          in the forex market but also commonly used in the cryptocurrency
          trading market. It’s conducted by executing hundreds of trades per day
          in an attempt to make a small profit from each trade. The trader
          undertaking scalping hopes to profit by exploiting the bid-ask spread.
          Scalping is a quick, paced strategy that tends to be dangerous at
          times. Therefore, you need to be hot on timing and vigilant for
          unpredictable assets.

          This is a popular strategy that depends on following up on news
          sources and recognizing price moves. The values of digital assets are
          guaranteed to move around every day; therefore, there’s always a
          chance to take advantage of this strategy. You need to make sure that
          you remain mindful of up and coming news and declarations since you’ll
          have moments before they affect the values of the digital assets.

          Inversion is a commonly discussed strategy utilized all over the
          world. It’s fondly referred to as pattern trading, switch trading, or
          pull back inclining. This strategy follows a fundamental rationale as
          it fixates on buying and moving day by day low and high pull-backs.
          Therefore, it requires the capacity to anticipating pull-backs quality
          and precisely distinguishing them.
